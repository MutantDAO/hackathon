# (DRAFT) PROPOSAL FOR DAO APPROVAL

# 1st MUTANT $FISHATHON

Goals of the competition
- Your project must send $FISH to the multisig wallet and provide value to the Mutant World.**
- Your project must be open source. 
- Your project must contribute value to the Mutant Community 
- Your project must be accessible by the mutant community. 
- Financial mechanisms must be trustless, auditable and on-chain.

** We are calling this FISH burning it is not technically burning tokens but for our purposes, this is an easy way to talk about it

## Prizes

The DAO is making available the following prizes to incentivize and reward to the teams developing the best $FISH sinks. The DAO will have the authority to select the winner.

- 1 first place. 10 ETH
- Up to 2 seconde places: 5 ETH
- Up to 2 third places: 2,5 ETH

Each project is allowed to include a transaction fee of up to 2,5% of the $FISH involved in the provisioning of the services provided by the project. This fee will be considered as a maintenance fee, and should go to the organization or individuals in charge of the maintenance of the project.


# The rules of the competition

1. There is no maximum or minimum team size. As a participant, you should make sure to check how many prizes are available per team.
2. Teams must be registered at the start of the competition
1. Teams can be formulated with anybody, regardless of ownership of an NFT token of the mutant verse (Mutant cat, Mutant gorilla or Serums).
1. Teams can of course gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
1. Teams can use an idea or code they had before the event.
2. Teams must release their code under an MIT license
3. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects only. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed. (KH - not sure I have an issue with this)
4. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up for judging. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that in order to ship it to production. Making large changes or adding new features for judging is not allowed.
5. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, or other unsporting behaviour.
6. Awarded projects will form part of the DAO’s code base and be available under an MIT license. This grants the DAO unlimited use of the code and/or services made available and allows modifications as decided by the DAO.
7. The awarded teams are expected to finish any development, testing and integrations needed to have their project operating in the mutantverse. The prize award should suffice for these purposes.
