# MUTANT WORLD HACKATHON

## Abstract

On November 6 2021 the Mutant DAO voted to set aside funds and hold a hackathon to enrich $FISH utility within the DAO ecosystem. The hackathon or $FISHathon as like to call it will be a call to arms for all developers/artists/creators that are part of this community to pool together all their resources and build out complementary $FISH utility as it benefits all mutant holders. If successful it may turn into a regular event for Mutant World.

## Introduction

MutantCats released in early October is the first DAO that purchases and fractionalizes Cool Cats, CryptoPunks and more valuable blue chip NFTs to be distributed to its members. The FISH token an ERC20 token on Ethereum, represents fractional shares of Cool Cats held in the vault but also is the primary token used for utility in the Mutant World. Each Mutant Cat NFT earns 10 FISH per day from staking.

As November 2021 began MutantGorillas were released at Auction. MutantGorillas can be staked to earn serum NFTS which can be used to cure MutantCats which allows them to breed virtual reality VX Cats to be used in the Metaverse. MutantGorillas play an important role as the first FISH sink to go live. FISH token is used to speed up serum production.

The MutantDAO has requested we setup a hackathon to expedite the number of innovative and creative ways we as a community can provide further FISH and SERUM utility aside from simply speeding up SERUM production or curing MutantCats. This hackathon is seen as a means to accomplish this.

## Problem, Solution, and Description

- FISH is a new ERC20 utility token.
- Without utility and with constant issuence FISH token value on secondary markets will drop as more fish comes on to the market.
- The value of FISH can be considered a function of scarcity versus utility or supply and demand.
- Increasing the number of ways that the community can use FISH will increase the demand for FISH.
- Increasing the number of ways the community could take FISH out of circulation will decrease the supply for FISH.
- Both of these things are good tokenomic outcomes.
- One solution would be to invest in projects that either
  1. Encourage people to transact in FISH
  2. Send FISH back to the treasury to be taken out of circulation.
- This Hackathon will put up substantial prizes and bounties for the best projects that both transact in FISH as well as pull FISH out of circulation.

## Tokenomics

- All entries to the competition that are launched to mainnet will add value to the mutant ecosystem so we suggest providing a kick back for all projects that send FISH to the multisig at a rate of 5% of all FISH burnt per project.
  - Eg.
    - I have a lottery transaction worth 100 FISH.
    - I send 50 FISH to the multisig and keep 50 FISH for the prize pool.
    - A fortnight later my wallet will receive 2.5 FISH (5% of 50).
- This also acts as an incentive on a few levels:
  - For maintaining the project should any maintenance issues comeup that need to be addressed.
  - To ensure that rates of FISH taken out of circulation in the app is high.
- Teams must first send FISH to the multisig to be eligable for the 5% kick back.
- The teams must commit to helping with incidental maintainence of their project - keeping their project online.
- That FISH will be released to the teams wallet fortnightly from the FISH giveaway pool from within the multisig.
  **[TREASURY PLEASE REVIEW]**
- Apps that do not take fish out of circulation will not be eligable for prizes or the kick back.

## Budget

The DAO have allowed the use of a maxium budget of 50 ETH for hackathon related activities. We feel we can limit our expediture to 30 ETH to save money for the DAO for use on further hackathons or development.

Prizes:

- 10 ETH ($43.5k USD) first prize
- 5 ETH ($21k USD) second prize
- 5 ETH ($21k USD) third prize
- 2.5 ETH ($10k) fourth prize
- 2.5 ETH ($10k) fifth prize

We feel these prize amounts are reasonable as to fund a sustained serious quick software engineering MVP in a startup environment would generally cost at a minimum 40-50 ETH

Incidentals:
5 ETH ($21k) marketing, hosting, technical and incidentals budget

## Guidelines

- There are no limits on team size but we would recommend working in smaller teams.
- Your project must send $FISH to the multisig wallet and provide value to the Mutant World.\*\*
- Your project MUST be delivered under an open source license, this is vital for the security of our community and it allows others in the community to build on top of what you have done.
- Your project must contribute value to the Mutant Community.
- Your project must be accessible by the mutant community and cannot be behind a paywall.
- Financial mechanisms must be trustless, auditable and on-chain.
- Creative Layer 2 solutions are fine and encouraged.
- Teams must be registered by the registration date. Late entries will not be accepted.
- Teams can have members from outside the MutantCat community although you will need at least one verified member on our discord for communication purposes.
- Teams are welcome to share, gain advice or support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and others.
- Teams are welcome to use an idea they have had prior to the event although they must be prepared to submit their project under the submission guidelines.
- Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking competition rules, poor conduct or other bad behaviour. This is an open supportive group. Sportsmanship, dignity and suportiveness are all important. We are here primarily to make the mutant community thrive. We are all on the one team.

9. Projects found to have any potentially malicious code not within the spirit of the FISHathon will be immediately disqualified.

- Minor unintentional security issues will be deal with on a case by case basis.
- Projects that are submitted to the DAO will form part of the DAO’s code base and be available under an MIT license. This grants the DAO unlimited use of the code and/or services made available and allows modifications as decided by the DAO.

# The rules of the competition

5. Teams can use an idea or code they had before the event.
6. Teams must release their code under an MIT license
7. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects only. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed. (KH - not sure I have an issue with this)
8. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up for judging. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that in order to ship it to production. Making large changes or adding new features for judging is not allowed.
9. Projects found to have security issues will not be deployed to mainnet.
10. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, or other unsporting behaviour.
11. Awarded projects will form part of the DAO’s code base and be available under an MIT license. This grants the DAO unlimited use of the code and/or services made available and allows modifications as decided by the DAO.
12. The awarded teams are expected to finish any development, testing and integrations needed to have their project operating in the mutantverse. The prize award should suffice for these purposes.
